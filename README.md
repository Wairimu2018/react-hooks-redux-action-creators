# Review and Dive into Actions

In this lesson, we will discuss:

- The properties of an action
- How to use action creators to create an action.

## Introduction

Actions are just **Plain Old JavaScript Objects** (POJOs), but that doesn't mean
we should ignore them. In this section, we'll discuss the properties of actions,
and how to use functions to create actions.

## Purpose of Actions

So as you know, we've been dispatching actions to our store to indicate the
changes we would make to our state. In this way, actions almost feel like the
request object or the parameters hash that you would see in a web application
like Ruby on Rails.

In **Rails**, a user clicking on a link kicks off a request, and that request is
ultimately passed to the controller, which is responsible for changing the
database. In **Redux**, a user may click on a button which dispatches an action,
and the reducer would take information from that action to change the state. You
saw in the last section that simply by placing a **console.log** in our reducer,
we could see a history of every action that was passed to the reducer, making
our debugging job easier.

## Structuring Actions

Now an action is simply a POJO that has a property of `type`. The reducer uses
this `type` property to see what it should do. Here is an example of a valid
action:

```javascript
const incrementCount = { type: "counter/increment" };
```

Remember that the store has a `dispatch` method which we can now use to dispatch
this action for it to be handled by the reducer.

```javascript
store.dispatch(incrementCount);
```

The dispatch method passes the action to the reducer, which then runs its
switch statement to decide what to do.

```javascript
function dispatch(action) {
  reducer(state, action);
}

function reducer(
  state = {
    count: 0,
  },
  action
) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "counter/increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

## Action Creators

Ok, now we know that our actions are simply a POJO with at least one property
called `type`. An example of using our actions is
`store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/increment' })`. Well, what if we do the
following:

```javascript
function incrementCount() {
  return { type: "counter/increment" };
}

store.dispatch(incrementCount());
```

Ok, so in the above lines of code we define a function called `incrementCount()`
whose job is to return an action. Then we execute the `incrementCount()`
function, which returns that action, and we dispatch that action to the store.
If you think that this is equivalent to
`store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/increment' })`, you are right.

We prefer wrapping our actions in a function, because oftentimes our actions
have some parts that will need to change, and a function comes in handy. For
example:

```javascript
function addTodo(todo) {
  return {
    type: "todos/add",
    payload: todo,
  };
}
```

So in the above function, we can imagine generating actions with different
payload properties depending on what we pass to the addTodo function.

```javascript
addTodo("buy groceries");
// -> { type: 'todos/add', payload: 'buy groceries' }

addTodo("watch netflix");
// -> { type: 'todos/add', payload: 'watch netflix' }
```

So essentially by wrapping our action in a function, we are able to easily keep
some of the action properties the same, like type, while changing others, like
the payload. We would dispatch the action in the following way:

```javascript
store.dispatch(addTodo("buy groceries"));
```

That would return the action `{ type: 'todos/add', payload: 'buy groceries' }`,
which we then send to the dispatch function.
